Fish Feeder Arduino - Include Directory
=====================================

This directory contains header files for the Fish Feeder Arduino system.

Structure:
- sensor_data.h: Core data structures and global variables
- sensor_service.h: High-performance sensor management class
- dht_sensor.h: DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor wrapper
- soil_sensor.h: Soil moisture sensor interface
- weight_sensor.h: HX711 load cell sensor wrapper
- voltage_sensor.h: Voltage monitoring with ACS712 current sensor
- blower.h: Blower motor control interface
- water_temp_sensor.h: DS18B20 water temperature (deprecated)
- acs712_sensor.h: ACS712 current sensor interface

Design Philosophy:
- Each sensor has its own dedicated header file
- Global instances are declared in headers and defined in .cpp files
- High-performance optimized for 1000Hz main loop
- Zero-delay operations with smart scheduling
- Memory-efficient with pre-allocated buffers

Usage:
Include only the headers you need in your main.cpp file.

Dependencies:
- DHT sensor library
- OneWire library  
- DallasTemperature library
- HX711 library
